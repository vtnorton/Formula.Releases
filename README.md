# 📰 The product (Formula.Releases)

## 👨🏻‍💻 How to run it

## 🔮 Roadmap

I'm sharing with you some of my plans to move foward with this project, right now the priorities comes like this:

* Architecture: Even though this project is a solution for architectural problems related to the application, it still needs improvements. The .md files needs to be copyed every time a new commit is made, as well it lives in the same repository. Any ideias on how to structure the project would be nice.

* Independency: Would love to make more stuff parameterizable so it can be used in other projects outside [vtnorton](https://vtnorton.com)

* Dark mode: this is a dependency from the [heartthrob project](https://github.com/vtnorton/heartthrob), once it have the dark mode then Formula.Releases should receive one as well.

* Docker: The project needs docker, and that says it all!

Constributors of all kinds from the community are welcome, but especially those that support the efforts above.
