### ðŸ“° Release notes
A while ago I removed the 'Hello World' function. When you create one file it created the hello world of this file. But it was buggy and ugly. So now, I present you the Sample Files. You can now add blank files from every language supported (including new extensions) and Hello World of that languages. It is a great feature that I thing you are going to love it.

I had also changed the New File page, including the name (previously: Add file). You can pick one category and the language of that category will show up. Once you select the language it will show to you the sample files of the language and related languages.

Example, if you want to build a HTML file, you can select the category web, and when you select HTML it will suggest the CSS and JavaScript files.
The top request, and must useful tool ever built on Formula is: 'Open With' feature. You can now select one file from you PC, right click on it, and open with Formula. You can also use this feature on mobile, take a shot. I think you are going to love it!

Another useful way to edit your files is dropping then on Formula. Try it!
You can now zoom you code to see better! This function is available on PC, HoloLens and Continuum.

I've added support for Lua and Pascal, because you your feedback. Also added support for APL and PGP. And had improved the language support of other languages. Now it can read and create files with this extensions: .h, .c++, .cc, .cxx, .hpp, .h++, .hh, .hxx, .map, .php3, .php4, .php5, .phtml, .BUILD, .bzl, .pyw, .xsl, .xsd.
